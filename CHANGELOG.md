# Changelog

Every change players would notice, newest first. The game reads this file
and shows it from the icon in the bottom-left corner of the main menu, and
the version it shows is the newest release here.

How to write it (details in "Changelog and versioning" in `docs/features.md`):
- Every pull request into `staging` adds lines under `## [Unreleased]`, in
  `### Added`, `### Changed` or `### Fixed`: one per change a player would
  notice, written for players, with old -> new numbers for balance changes.
- A release is `staging` merged into `main`: `[Unreleased]` becomes
  `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD` with a sentence or two summing the release up,
  and a fresh empty `[Unreleased]` goes on top.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- City 17: squads of three Combine soldiers now patrol the old town's
  roads, the plaza and the Citadel's square, keeping formation; when one
  of them spots you the whole squad stops and turns your way.
- City 17's Combine soldiers talk over their radios, standing at their
  checkpoints or out on patrol: a crackle of radio and what they said over
  their heads, a mate answering. They shout when they spot you and call it
  in when one of them goes down. Their volume has its own slider in the
  sound settings ("Combine soldiers' radio").
- City 17's Combine soldiers see twice as wide as before: their cones of
  sight are 60 degrees across (was 30).
- City 17's Combine soldiers hunt you: spot one and he comes after you
  (90 px/s, so a walk won't lose him but a sprint will), shooting as he
  comes, and his squad comes with him. Lose him and he searches where he
  last saw you. Shoot one from where he can't see you and he goes that
  way looking. When a soldier goes down, the others within earshot come
  to see what happened. They all go back to their posts and beats after.
- City 17 has citizens now, in their blue-grey jumpsuits, wandering the
  streets (no police there).
- Pedestrians scatter when a gun goes off near them, anyone's gun, in
  every city: a moment of shock, then they run for it.

### Fixed
- City 17: medkits and energy drinks no longer turn up bunched together
  on the railway behind the train, where nobody can reach them.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-01

A-Man arrives: a new city event with his own boss fight and theme, and
City 17, the first new map, at the end of his trail.

### Added
- A-Man, a new city event (host: F8). A very familiar man in a suit, fake
  glasses and a stuck-on moustache walks the city and teleports straight
  through anyone in his way for 60 damage. A line shows where he is going
  just before he goes: get off it. He also opens his briefcase and lets
  out a horde of sentry turrets that scuttle about spraying bullets in
  random directions; one shot knocks a turret over. He has his own theme
  music.
- City 17, a new map and the first stop on A-Man's trail: take "The man
  with the moustache" from the Jobs board and step off the train, then
  make your way through the station, the plaza, the old town, the wall and
  over the canal to the Citadel. He says hello when you arrive. Combine
  soldiers guard every checkpoint on the way: get past them (or through
  them) and reach the Citadel's doors to finish the job.
- Teleport, a new ability A-Man drops when he goes down: vanish and
  reappear up to 700 px away, tearing through anyone in between for 50
  damage. Never sold.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-30

The first numbered release: everything built so far, and this changelog to
keep track of what comes next.

### Added
- LAN multiplayer: host a game or join one from the server browser, with
  recent servers remembered. The host runs the world; everyone else sends
  what they want to do.
- Saved worlds: money, upgrades, loadouts, vehicles and property are kept
  between sessions, and owners who were offline still get paid.
- The city: a generated grid of roads, buildings, parks and parking lots,
  the sea round it, and surroundings past every map's edge (forest,
  beach, bluff, cul-de-sac and outskirts).
- Driving: cars built from their own models with their own handling, engine
  sound through four gears, skid marks, car-to-car collisions and name tags
  on parked cars.
- On foot: get out of your car and walk, sprint on stamina, dodge on Space,
  and take any empty car in reach.
- Guns and a gun wheel, a flamethrower, reloading, and damage types
  (bullet, explosive, fire, impact, shock, melee) with burning,
  resistances and hit and death effects to match.
- Abilities: heal aura, leap, panic fart, open borders, MG nest, second
  wind, overclock and more, each with its own icon and cooldown.
- Tiers for everything you equip: common, uncommon, rare and legendary.
- The inventory screen (I): drag guns, abilities, armor and clothes onto
  your character, trash what you do not want.
- Armor and gear: a kevlar vest, and clothes for the head, body, pants and
  shoes slots that each improve something.
- Money: Federal Commie Koins (Fcks), dropped by the dead and picked up
  off the road.
- The shop, with tabs for guns, ammo, abilities, supplies, cars and
  delivery drivers for hire.
- The gym: spend Fcks on health, stamina, reach, regen, slots and dodge
  distance.
- Real estate and buildings: buy plots, build factories, hospitals, shops
  and garages on them, and hire drivers to keep the factories fed.
- Quests from the Jobs building: Crazy Karen, the alien hunt, the D-Day
  landing and Shotgun's Bluff, each with its own boss, and bosses that tire.
- City events: a boss (the tripod, the runner and others) comes into the
  streets and goes after players and their buildings.
- Police that patrol, see crimes in their sight cones and chase you, and
  stand down while a city event is on.
- Pedestrians that wander the streets and flee from cars, and AI drivers.
- A minimap and a big map, arrows at the screen edge towards things off
  screen, a low-health halo and a tidy HUD.
- Settings for sound, controls, video and the server you host, a controls
  overview on F1, and cheats typed while playing.
- An inclusive mode on the main menu.
- A changelog on the main menu: the icon in the bottom-left corner opens it,
  and a dot on it means there is something you have not read yet.
- A version number, shown next to the changelog icon.

### Fixed
- The event menu (F8) is tall enough for every event's description.
